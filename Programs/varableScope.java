/*
 As the comments indicate, the variable x is declared at the start of main( )â€™s scope and is accessible to all subsequent code within main( ). Within the if block, y is declared. Since a block defines a scope, y is only visible to other code within its block. This is why outside of 
its block, the line y = 100; is commented out. If you remove the leading comment symbol, a compile-time error will occur, because y is not visible outside of its block. Within the if
block, x can be used because code within a block (that is, a nested scope) has access to variables declared by an enclosing scope.

Within a block, variables can be declared at any point, but are valid only after they are declared. Thus, if you define a variable at the start of a method, it is available to all of the code within that method. Conversely, if you declare a variable at the end of a block, it is effectively useless, because no code will have access to it. For example, this fragment is invalid because count cannot be used prior to its declaration:

// This fragment is wrong!
count = 100; // oops! cannot use count before it is declared!
int count;
